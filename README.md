Ai_Asssitant_usage Project Summary

This project analyzes AI assistant usage by students. Key findings include: most sessions were short, undergraduates used the assistant the most, and writing was the most common task. Nearly 48% of students completed their tasks, while a small portion gave up. The analysis provides insights into student engagement, task types, and overall satisfaction with the AI assistant.
